A very hacky killboard frontend for zkillboard. Currently deployed on killboard.poitot.com for Clockwork Pineapple.

Header and footer bits not included. Batteries not included.

Adjust URLs as necessary. Probably for production use only if your EvE online corp/alliance has a sense of humor.


DID YOU KNOW? POITOT IS THE ONLY NAMED SYSTEM IN SYNDICATE!

Zkillboard URL is broken in the current source, since for some reason zkillboard api stopped allowing us to only grab the last 100 or so things.
